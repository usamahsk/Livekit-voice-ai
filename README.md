# LiveKit Agent

A voice AI project built with [LiveKit Agents for Python](https://github.com/livekit/agents) and [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/). This project is designed to work with coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) — see [Coding agent support](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/coding-agents/) for setup tips.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was converted to code from the LiveKit Agent Builder. The code is identical to production deployments from the builder. Follow the steps below to make it your own and deploy it to LiveKit Cloud. once you do so, you can delete the version in the builder.

## Next steps

### Run and deploy your agent

**Get your agent running locally and in production:**

1. **Run locally**: Follow the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section below to set up your environment and test the agent
2. **Deploy to production**: See the [Deploy to production](#deploy-to-production) section for deployment options and best practices

### Quickstart

**Get up and running** so you can start customizing:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```console
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Set up your LiveKit credentials:**

   Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/), then configure your environment. You can either:

   - **Manual setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:
     - `LIVEKIT_URL`
     - `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
     - `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`

   - **Automatic setup** (recommended): Use the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/basics/cli/):
     ```bash
     lk cloud auth
     lk app env -w -d .env.local
     ```

3. **Download required models:**
   ```console
   uv run python src/agent.py download-files
   ```
   This downloads [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/logic/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/logic/turns/turn-detector/) models.

4. **Test your agent:**
   ```console
   uv run python src/agent.py console
   ```
   This lets you speak to your agent directly in your terminal.

5. **Run for development:**
   ```console
   uv run python src/agent.py dev
   ```
   Use this when connecting to a frontend or telephony. This puts your agent into your LiveKit Cloud project, so use a different project if you don't want to affect production traffic.


## Customize your agent

Once your agent is running, enhance it for your use case:

- **Customize AI models**: Your agent uses a voice AI pipeline built on [LiveKit Inference](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/inference). More than 50 model providers are supported, including [Realtime models](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/realtime).

- **Add tests**: You can add a full test suite to your agent. See the [testing documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/testing/) for more information.

- **Build reliable workflows**: For complex agents, use [tasks and handoffs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows/) instead of long instruction prompts. This minimizes latency and improves reliability by structuring your agent into focused, reusable components.

### Get help from AI coding assistants

**Supercharge your development** with AI coding assistants that understand LiveKit. This project works seamlessly with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/), and other AI coding tools.

For your convenience, LiveKit offers both a CLI and an [MCP server](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/developer-tools/docs-mcp/) that can be used to browse and search its documentation. The [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/basics/cli/) (`lk docs`) works with any coding agent that can run shell commands. Install it for your platform:

**macOS:**

```console
brew install livekit-cli
```

**Linux:**

```console
curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io/cli | bash
```

**Windows:**

```console
winget install LiveKit.LiveKitCLI
```

The `lk docs` subcommand requires version 2.15.0 or higher. Check your version with `lk --version` and update if needed. Once installed, your coding agent can search and browse LiveKit documentation directly from the terminal:

```console
lk docs search "voice agents"
lk docs get-page /agents/start/voice-ai-quickstart
```

See the [Using coding agents](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/coding-agents/) guide for more details, including MCP server setup.

**Customize the AI assistant context**: The project includes an [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file that guides AI assistants on how to work with this codebase. **Edit this file** to add your own project-specific context, patterns, and preferences. Learn more at [https://agents.md](https://agents.md).

## Frontend development

If you don't alread have a frontend, use the following templates and guides to get started on one:

| Platform | Starter Template | What to customize |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Web** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-react`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-react) | React & Next.js—customize UI, add features, integrate with your backend |
| **iOS/macOS** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift) | Native apps for iOS, macOS, visionOS—add platform-specific features |
| **Flutter** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter) | Cross-platform—customize for Android, iOS, web, desktop |
| **React Native** | [`livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native) | Mobile with Expo—add native modules, customize navigation |
| **Android** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-android`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-android) | Kotlin & Jetpack Compose—build Material Design UI |
| **Web Embed** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed) | Widget for any website—customize styling, add to your site |
| **Telephony** | [Documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/telephony/) | Add phone calling—configure SIP, add call routing, customize prompts |

## Observability

LiveKit provides deep session insights for your agents through [Agent Observability](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/observability/). Monitor conversation quality, track latency metrics, and debug agent behavior in production.

## Deploy to production

To deploy your agent to production, you can use the LiveKit CLI:

```console
lk agent create
```

See the [deploying to production](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/agents/) guide for detailed instructions and optimization tips.
